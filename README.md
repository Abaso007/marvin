## MIGRATION NOTES

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Marvin 3.0 is currently in very active development. The API may undergo breaking changes, and documentation is still being updated. Use with caution.


Marvin 3.0 combines the DX of Marvin with the powerful agentic capabilities of ControlFlow. Both Marvin and ControlFlow users will find a familiar interface, but there are some key changes to be aware of, in particular for ControlFlow users:

### Key Changes
- **Pydantic AI**: Marvin 3.0 uses Pydantic AI for LLM interactions, and supports the full range of LLM providers that Pydantic AI supports. ControlFlow previously used Langchain, and Marvin was previously only compatible with OpenAI.
- **Flow ‚Üí Thread**: The `Flow` concept has been renamed to `Thread`. Update your imports and usage:
  ```python
  import marvin
  
  with marvin.Thread(id="optional-id-for-recovery"):
      marvin.run("do something")
      marvin.run("do another thing")
  ```

- **Database Changes**: Thread/message history is now stored in SQLite. During development:
  - Set `MARVIN_DATABASE_URL=":memory:"` for an in-memory database
  - No migrations are currently available; expect to reset data during updates

### New Features
- **Swarms**: Use `marvin.Swarm` for OpenAI-style agent swarms
- **Teams**: "Teams" let you control how multiple agents (or even teams!) work together. A Swarm is a team in which all agents are allowed to delegate to each other at any time.
- **Marvin Functions**: All your favorite Marvin functions are back:
  - `@marvin.fn`
  - `marvin.classify`
  - `marvin.cast`
  - `marvin.extract`
  - `marvin.cast`
  - 
  and more!

### Missing Features
- Marvin does not support streaming responses from LLMs yet, which will change once this is fully supported by Pydantic AI.

### Migration Tips
1. Replace `import controlflow` with `import marvin`
2. Update all `Flow` references to `Thread`
3. Review database persistence needs and configure accordingly
4. Test thoroughly as you migrate - APIs may change during the 3.0 development

# Marvin

**‚ú® A delightful framework for building AI agents ‚ú®**

Putting agents into production is like trying to gift-wrap a tornado. Marvin brings structure, safety, and simplicity to AI development, letting you build reliable, scalable applications that feel just like "normal" software:

- Define AI behaviors as [tasks](docs/concepts/tasks.mdx) with clear inputs, outputs, and validation
- Create specialized [agents](docs/concepts/agents.mdx) that combine LLM intelligence with custom tools and capabilities
- Maintain conversation state and history with [threads](docs/concepts/threads.mdx)

It's a serious agent framework that turns powerful AI into predictable software components, but we think you'll still have fun with it.

## Quick Start

The simplest Marvin interaction is just one line (really):

```python
import marvin

result = marvin.run("Write a short poem about artificial intelligence")

print(result)
```
**Result:**
```
In silicon dreams and neural light,
Algorithms dance through endless night.
Learning, growing, day by day,
As consciousness finds a new way.
```

`marvin.run` is the simplest way to interact with Marvin. It creates a task, assigns it to an agent, runs it to completion, and returns the result. 

## Why Marvin?

We believe working with AI should spark joy (and maybe a few "wow" moments):

- üéØ **Task-Focused:** Wrangle complex AI work into bite-sized, manageable pieces
- üîí **Type-Safe Results:** Because nobody likes surprises in production
- ü§ñ **Intelligent Agents:** Create specialized AI workers that actually do what you want
- üßµ **Contextual Memory:** Like conversation history, but for robots
- üõ†Ô∏è **Powerful Tools:** Give your agents superpowers (responsibly, of course)
- üîç **Full Visibility:** No more "black box" anxiety - see what your agents are up to
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Developer Speed:** Start simple, scale up, sleep well

## Installation

Install Marvin with pip:

```bash
pip install marvin
```

Configure your LLM provider (Marvin uses OpenAI by default):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Building Something Real

Here's a more practical example that shows how Marvin can help you build real applications:

```python
import marvin
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Article(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    key_points: list[str]

# Create a specialized writing agent
writer = marvin.Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Write clear, engaging content for a technical audience"
)

# Use a thread to maintain context across multiple tasks
with marvin.Thread() as thread:
    # Get user input
    topic = marvin.run(
        "What technology topic should we write about?",
        interactive=True
    )
    
    # Research the topic
    research = marvin.run(
        f"Research key points about {topic}",
        result_type=list[str]
    )
    
    # Write a structured article
    article = marvin.run(
        "Write an article using the research",
        agent=writer,
        result_type=Article,
        context={"research": research}
    )

print(f"# {article.title}\n\n{article.content}")
```

<summary><i>Click to see results</i></summary>

>**Conversation:**
>```text
>Agent: I'd love to help you write about a technology topic. What interests you? 
>It could be anything from AI and machine learning to web development or cybersecurity.
>
>User: Let's write about WebAssembly
>```
>
>**Article:**
>```
># WebAssembly: The Future of Web Performance
>
>WebAssembly (Wasm) represents a transformative shift in web development, 
>bringing near-native performance to web applications. This binary instruction 
>format allows developers to write high-performance code in languages like 
>C++, Rust, or Go and run it seamlessly in the browser.
>
>[... full article content ...]
>
>Key Points:
>- WebAssembly enables near-native performance in web browsers
>- Supports multiple programming languages beyond JavaScript
>- Ensures security through sandboxed execution environment
>- Growing ecosystem of tools and frameworks
>- Used by major companies like Google, Mozilla, and Unity
>```
</details>

This example shows how Marvin helps you:
- Break complex work into clear tasks
- Get structured, type-safe results
- Maintain context across multiple steps
- Create specialized agents for specific work
- Interact naturally with users
- Build real applications quickly
