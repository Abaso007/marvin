title: Cast
description: Convert data between types while preserving meaning
icon: right-to-bracket
---

The `cast` function is your bridge between natural language and structured data types. It transforms `str → T` while preserving meaning, making it easy to convert:
- Natural numbers ("three point five" → 3.5)
- Casual responses ("sounds good" → True)
- Time expressions ("next Tuesday" → datetime)
- Rich descriptions ("John is 25" → Person(name="John", age=25))

For complex transformations, consider creating a custom task. The `cast` function is a convenient wrapper around Marvin's task system - see [Tasks](/concepts/tasks) for more details.

## Usage

Convert natural language descriptions of numbers into their numeric representation:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

# Convert text to a number
price = marvin.cast("three dollars and fifty cents", float)
print(price)
```

```python Result
3.5
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

- `data`: The input data to convert (any type)
- `target`: The target type to convert to (defaults to `str`)
- `instructions`: Optional instructions to guide the conversion
- `agent`: Optional custom agent to use
- `thread`: Optional thread for conversation context
- `context`: Optional additional context

## Async Support

The function is also available in an async version:

```python
import marvin
import asyncio

async def main():
    result = await marvin.cast_async(
        "three point five",
        float
    )
    print(result)  # 3.5

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Examples

### Converting Numbers

Convert natural language descriptions of quantities into numeric values:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

price = marvin.cast("three dollars and fifty cents", float)
print(price)
```

```python Result
3.5
```
</CodeGroup>

### Boolean Conversion

Interpret natural language expressions as boolean values:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

answer = marvin.cast("that sounds great!", bool)
print(answer)
```

```python Result
True
```
</CodeGroup>

### Structured Data

Extract structured information from natural language descriptions:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Address:
    street: str
    city: str
    country: str

address = marvin.cast(
    "123 Main St in New York, USA",
    Address
)
print(f"{address.street}, {address.city}, {address.country}")
```

```python Result
"123 Main St", "New York", "USA"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Custom Instructions

Use instructions to control how text is interpreted and formatted:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

phone = marvin.cast(
    "call me at 1-800-555-0123",
    str,
    instructions="Extract just the phone number in XXX-XXXX format"
)
print(phone)
```

```python Result
"555-0123"
```
</CodeGroup>
