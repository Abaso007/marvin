# AI Application

Looking for `AIApplication` from `marvin` 1.x?

After the release of OpenAI's Assistants API, we've decided to make `AIApplication` an `Assistant` subclass.

Both `Assistant` and `AIApplication` are in beta, and are subject to change. You can read the quickstart for `Assistant` [here](/src/marvin/beta/assistants/README.md).
