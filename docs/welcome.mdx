## What is Marvin?

**Marvin is a Python framework for building AI applications with LLMs.**

Marvin provides a clean, intuitive interface for working with large language models (LLMs) while handling all the complexity of state management, conversation history, and agent coordination.

## Quick Examples

### Simple Tasks

The fastest way to use Marvin is with `marvin.run()`:

```python
import marvin

# Run a simple task
result = marvin.run("Write a haiku about artificial intelligence")
print(result)

# Provide additional context for more accurate results
result = marvin.run(
    "Summarize the data in 2-3 sentences",
    context={"data": "...your data here..."}
)
```


### Specialized Agents

Create agents with specific skills and personalities:

```python
import marvin

# Create specialized agents
poet = marvin.Agent(
    name="Poet",
    instructions="You are an expert poet who writes in various styles."
)

scientist = marvin.Agent(
    name="Scientist",
    instructions="You are a scientist who explains complex topics clearly."
)

# Use them for specific tasks
explanation = marvin.run(
    "Explain entropy briefly",
    agents=[scientist]
)

poem = marvin.run(
    "Write a haiku about entropy",
    agents=[poet],
    context={"scientific_explanation": explanation}
)
```

### Structured Data

Get results in exactly the format you need:

```python
import marvin
from typing import List

class Character(marvin.Model):
    name: str
    role: str
    motivation: str

# Get structured results
characters = marvin.run(
    "Create three characters for a mystery story",
    result_type=List[Character]
)

for char in characters:
    print(f"{char.name} - {char.role}")
    print(f"Motivation: {char.motivation}\n")
```

### Persistent Memory

Give your agents memory that persists across conversations:

```python
import marvin

# Create a memory module
preferences = marvin.Memory(
    key="user_preferences",
    instructions="Remember user preferences and style"
)

# Create an agent with memory
assistant = marvin.Agent(memories=[preferences])

# The agent will remember information across conversations
marvin.run(
    "Learn about the user's writing style preferences",
    agents=[assistant],
    interactive=True
)
```
