Marvin is a framework for building AI workflows that bridges the gap between 
structured programming and the natural language capabilities of LLMs. It 
accomplishes this through three core concepts: Tasks, Agents, and Threads.

To create an agentic workflow, you define clear objectives (Tasks), assign 
intelligent entities to accomplish them (Agents), and maintain conversation history 
over time (Threads). This approach allows you to harness the power of AI while 
maintaining fine-grained control over your applications.

## ðŸ“‹ Tasks

Tasks represent the structured side of Marvin. They are specific, well-defined 
objectives that form the backbone of your workflow. Tasks encapsulate the "what" 
and "how" of your AI-driven operations, providing a clear, programmatic structure.

Key features of Tasks:
- Define specific objectives for AI to accomplish
- Specify expected result types and validation criteria
- Can include instructions, context, and tools for execution
- Support both tool-based and conversational responses
- Can be run individually or orchestrated as a sequence

Learn more in the [Tasks](/concepts/tasks) section.

## ðŸ¦¾ Agents

Agents embody the unstructured, natural language side of Marvin. They are 
AI-powered entities capable of understanding and generating human-like text,
bringing flexibility and adaptability to your workflows.

Key features of Agents:
- Represent configurable AI entities with their own identity and capabilities
- Can be specialized for specific tasks through instructions and tools
- Can work individually or as part of a team
- Can be interactive, allowing communication with users
- Allow configuration of different LLM models to power their responses

Learn more in the [Agents](/concepts/agents) section.

## ðŸ§µ Threads

Threads provide conversation history and context for tasks and agents. They maintain 
state across multiple interactions, allowing agents to reference and build upon 
previous work.

Key features of Threads:
- Maintain conversation history across multiple tasks
- Provide shared context for sequential operations
- Automatically persist state between runs
- Support both explicit and implicit creation

Learn more in the [Threads](/concepts/threads) section.

## Putting it all together

In a typical Marvin application:

1. You create one or more Tasks to represent specific objectives
2. Agents work on Tasks using their instructions and tools
3. A Thread maintains context and history across multiple interactions

This structure allows you to create powerful, flexible AI workflows while 
maintaining control over the process and ensuring that outputs align with your 
application's requirements.

For a quick example:

```python
import marvin

# Create a thread to maintain conversation history
with marvin.Thread() as thread:
    # Create specialized agents
    researcher = marvin.Agent(
        name="Researcher",
        instructions="Research and analyze topics thoroughly"
    )
    writer = marvin.Agent(
        name="Writer", 
        instructions="Write engaging content"
    )
    
    # Run multiple tasks with different agents
    topic = marvin.run(
        "What topic should we research?",
        agents=[researcher],
        interactive=True,
    )
    
    research = marvin.run(
        f"Research key points about {topic}",
        agents=[researcher],
        result_type=list[str]
    )
    
    article = marvin.run(
        "Write an article using the research",
        agents=[writer],
        context={"research": research}
    )
```

This example shows how Tasks, Agents and Threads work together to create a 
complete workflow. The Thread maintains context across multiple tasks, while 
different Agents contribute their specialized capabilities to achieve the overall 
objective.
